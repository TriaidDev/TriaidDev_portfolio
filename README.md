### Backend Deployment Options

For the backend API, you have several options:

1. **Netlify Functions**: Deploy serverless functions alongside your frontend
   - Create a `netlify/functions` directory
   - Move the API logic to serverless functions
   - Configure redirects in `netlify.toml`

2. **Vercel Serverless Functions**: Similar to Netlify Functions
   - Create an `api` directory at the root
   - Implement your API endpoints as serverless functions

3. **Heroku**: For a dedicated backend server
   - Create a Node.js/Express backend
   - Deploy to Heroku

4. **Supabase**: For a fully-managed backend
   - Use Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
   - Connect using the Supabase client

5. **Firebase**: Alternative to Supabase
   - Use Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Cloud Functions
   - Connect using the Firebase SDK

## Backend Implementation

This project includes a simulated backend API for the contact form. To implement a real backend:

1. Create a server using Node.js/Express, or use serverless functions
2. Implement the following endpoints:
   - POST /api/contact - Process contact form submissions
3. Connect to a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.) to store the messages
4. Implement email notifications using services like SendGrid or Nodemailer
5. Update the frontend API functions in `src/api/FormHandler.ts` to point to your real backend

## Environment Variables

For production, you'll need to set up the following environment variables:

- `VITE_API_URL` - URL to your backend API
- `VITE_EMAIL_SERVICE` - Email service for notifications (if applicable)

## Further Customization

- Update colors in `tailwind.config.ts` to match your brand
- Replace placeholder content with your actual services and projects
- Add Google Analytics or other tracking tools
